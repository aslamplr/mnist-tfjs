# MNIST Handwritten digit classification in browser
MNIST Handwritten digit classification in browser using tensorflow.js

This repo is created while exercising "Tensorflow.js â€“ Handwritten digit recognition with CNNs" tutorial
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-classfication

I have made few modifications to the original tutorial. Should be straightforward enough to follow.

### Modifications from the original tutorial -
- `data.js` has been renamed to `data.ts` and annotated with types using typescript
- `script.js` has been renamed to `training.ts` and annotated with types using typescript

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

For windows users -
